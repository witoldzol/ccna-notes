* Router
** reset password
- break during bootstrap
- this will take you to rommon mode
- set confreg to 0x2142
- restart router
- go to privilaged mode
- copy start to running
- update password in running config
- reenable interfaces (no shutdown)
- config terminal
- change config-register ( different command than in rommon) back to 0x2102
- copy run to start

** show commands
- show version
: will show operating system && configuration register being used

- show flash 
: will show files stored on flash

- show interface brief
: status of interfaces (down,up,administratively down)

* Switch
** EIA/TIA-568-A/B (RJ-45 cable)
- 8 pins
- pin 1&2 are for transmitting Tx
- pin 3&6 are for receiving Rx
- rest are used mosting in Gibyte ethernet

Straight through cable maps same pins to same pin outputs
Cross over cable switches Tx with Rx at the end of the cable ( they aren't used any more, interfaces figure pins out automatically)
(use cross over calbe when connecting two same-like devices : eg> pc to pc, switch to switch ...)

Pc-Pc use cross
Pc-Router (router is a Pc) use cros
pc-switch - straight through cable
switch-router - straight through cable 

** Coax cable

- rest are used mosting in Gibyte ethernet

Straight through cable maps same pins to same pin outputs
Cross over cable switches Tx with Rx at the end of the cable ( they aren't used any more, interfaces figure pins out automatically)
(use cross over calbe when connecting two same-like devices : eg> pc to pc, switch to switch ...)

Pc-Pc use cross
Pc-Router (router is a Pc) use cros
pc-switch - straight through cable
switch-router - straight through cable 

** Coax cable
RG-6
F-type connector (single cable sticking out, surrounded by metal nut we can use to screw it to other end)

** Serial cables
V.35

DS1 cable
(uses RJ-45 connector)

** fiber optics cables
- single mode cable - LX laser
up to 70km

- multi mode cable - SX laser
0.5-1km

you cannot combine SX & LX

Connectors:
ST
SC
LC 

** WiFi 802.11

*** 2.4 GHz
Channel available:
1, 6 , 11

Each channel needs 22Mhz 'padding'

*** 5 GHz
36,40,44,48
149,153,157,161

52-140 - used by military, if used you need to implement DFS


MIMO - multiple in, multiple out

802.11ac - todays standard
Uses 5GHz ONLY 
has beamforming & MIMO

** Ethernet
*** CSMA/CD
Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection

- Collision Domain
Group of devices that will detect a voltage spike (10V)

Collision Detection applies only to HALF DUPLEX

FULL DUPLEX essentially eliminates need for collision detection

*** speed
Ethernet 10Mbps -- Half && Full Duplex
FastEthernet 100 -- Half && Full
GigabitEthernet 1Gps Full duplex ONLY !
10GigabitEthernet
40GigabitEthernet

*** frame
: Destination MAC
: Source MAC

: Type (16 bits) 
identifies type of message being carried, usually, which layer 3 protocol is used (ipv4/6)
ipv4 - 0x0800
ipv6 - 0x08DD
ARP message - 0x0806

: Data (max 1500 bytes)
: FCS (32bits)
frame check sequence, used for integrity test on frame
uses CRC - Cyclical Redundancy Check

puts frame bits into CRC -> gets 32 bit hash -> stores it in FCS
when frame is received, CRC is recalculated and compared to FCS 
if mismatch -> frame is trashed -> NO REQUEST to resend is made ( layer 2 doesn't handle those things )
